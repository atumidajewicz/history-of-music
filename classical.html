<h3>What is a classical music?</h3>
<p>The classical era was a time frame that spanned from 1750 to 1830.
Some of the composers who lived in this era include Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert.
Classical music is understood as any composition that emerged during classicism.
The classical style emerged as a rupture against the strict rules of baroque music 
which was characterized by several melodies overlapping simultaneously.
The English term classical was originally derived from the Latin word classicus, which
originally referred to the highest class of ancient roman citizens.
The classical period, which is also known as the Age of Enlightenment in world history,
was a time when schools and Universities were first established. The first encyclopedias and 
dictionaries were published and the piano was invented. The first concert halls were also built 
in this era.
